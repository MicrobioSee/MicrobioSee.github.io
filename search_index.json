It should be noted that the focus of these two dissimilarity coefficients is different. In analysis, Jaccard only considers the presence or absence of species in the sample, not the abundance. The Bray-curtis calculation not only considers the presence or absence of species in the sample, but also considers the relative abundance of different species. This button can choose whether to perform R-value and P-value calculations on the data R^2 can quantify the strength of the relationship between the model response variable and the dependent variable The p-value test can determine how reliable the fitted equation is. 2.2.3 PCA whether to add labels to each point Adjust label position Adjust label font size Adjust the aspect ratio of the drawing 2.2.4 NMDS The function offers different standardization methods for community data: Dissimilarity index, partial match to “manhattan,” “euclidean,” “canberra,” “clark,” “bray,” “kulczynski,” “jaccard,” “gower,” “altGower,” “morisita,” “horn,” “mountford,” “raup,” “binomial,” “chao,” “cao,” “mahalanobis,” “chisq” or “chord.”It is the same as PCA distance matrix method.
